# Introduction to Neural Networks

## What is a neuron

Biologically, a neuron is a cell transmitting an electrical signal from neurons to other neurons. Neuron are composed of 4 main parts :
*  Dendrits, capting input signal
*  Nucleus, prcessing this signal
*  Axon, conveying the signal
*  Axon Terminals, transmitting the signal to next neurons

The Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is composed of neurons similar to biological neurons. The artificial neuron (or perceptron) is also composed of four parts and they work in the same way.
